# leaflet-challenge

### This project is intended to demonstrate the locations where earthquake happened in all continents, with data for all magnitudes and months.


Due to security reasons, the Config File with the API key is not uploaded in this assignment. In order to properly run this application, follow the steps below:

* Make sure to create an Mapbox token (API_KEY) and insert under statis/js/ directory, and add a file called config.js with the API key in it.
Config File content should contain:

// API key
var API_KEY = "Your code here!"

* Download the content of this repo and after adding the proper config.js into the directory indicated, make sure to run the http server on your local machine.

Enjoy the visual!
